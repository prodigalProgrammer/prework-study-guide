# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This guide has been created to help collate my learning. My motivation behind building this project was to retain as much information as possible from this prework. I have been able to learn more about HTML, CSS, Git, the CLI and JavaScript by working through this project, and can now return to this guide whenever I forget something I've learned previously.

## Usage

This guide is a single-page webpage, so you will see everything listed at once. There is a header and footer detailed by the blue background.
There are five sections in total featured in the guide:

- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** - Notes that I learnt about HTML through the Prework.
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** - Notes that I learnt about CSS through the Prework.
- **CLI (Command Line Interface)** - Notes that I added for the Command Line Interface, as this was a completely new interface I had not used before.
- **Git** - Notes that I added for the Git application, which allows me to pull, push and merge branches.
- **JavaScript** - Notes that I learnt about JavaScript through the Prework.

## Features

As I have some prior experience with CSS, I added some features:

- Different coloured background on the body element.
- You can hover over each section to change the background colour and scale which highlights the card you're reading.
